				<p>Indicates what notifications the user agent will trigger when the accessibility tree within a live region is modified. See related <a href="#aria-atomic" class="property-reference"><code>aria-atomic</code></a>.</p>
				<p>The <a href="#dfn-attribute" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">attribute</a> is represented as a space delimited list of the following <span>values</span>: <code>additions</code>, <code>removals</code>, <code>text</code>; or a single catch-all value <code>all</code>.</p>
				<p>This is used to describe <a href="#dfn-semantics" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">semantically</a> meaningful changes, as opposed to merely presentational ones. For example, nodes that are removed from the top of a log are merely removed for purposes of creating room for other entries, and the removal of them does not have meaning. However, in the case of a buddy list, removal of a buddy name indicates that they are no longer online, and this is a meaningful <a href="#dfn-event" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">event</a>. In that case <a href="#aria-relevant" class="property-reference"><code>aria-relevant</code></a> will be set to <code>all</code>. When the <code>aria-relevant</code> attribute is not provided, the default value, <code>additions text</code>, indicates that text modifications and node additions are relevant, but that node removals are irrelevant.</p>
				<div class="note">
<div role="heading" class="note-title marker" id="h-note-51" aria-level="5"><span>Note</span></div>
<p class=""><code>aria-relevant</code> values of removals or all are to be used sparingly. Assistive technologies only need to be informed of content removal when its removal represents an important change, such as a buddy leaving a chat room.</p>
</div>
				<div class="note">
<div role="heading" class="note-title marker" id="h-note-52" aria-level="5"><span>Note</span></div>
<p class="">Text removals should only be considered relevant if one of the specified values is 'removals' or 'all'. For example, for a text change from 'foo' to 'bar' in a live region with a default <code>aria-relevant</code> value, the text addition ('bar') would be spoken, but the text removal ('foo') would not.</p>
</div>
				<p><code>aria-relevant</code> is an optional attribute of live regions. This is a suggestion to <a href="#dfn-assistive-technology" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">assistive technologies</a>, but assistive technologies are not required to present changes of all the relevant types.</p>
				<p>When <code>aria-relevant</code> is not defined, an element's value is inherited from the nearest ancestor with a defined value. Although the value is a <a href="#valuetype_token_list">token list</a>, inherited values are not additive; the value provided on a descendant element completely overrides any inherited value from an ancestor element.</p>
				<p>When text changes are denoted as relevant, user agents <em class="rfc2119" title="MUST">MUST</em> monitor any descendant node change that affects the <a href="#textalternativecomputation">text alternative computation</a> of the live region as if the accessible name were determined from contents (<a href="#namecalculation">nameFrom: contents</a>). For example, a text change would be triggered if the <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> <code>alt</code> attribute of a contained image changed. However, no change would be triggered if there was a text change to a node outside the live region, even if that node was referenced (via <a href="#aria-labelledby" class="property-reference"><code>aria-labelledby</code></a>) by an element contained in the live region.</p>
